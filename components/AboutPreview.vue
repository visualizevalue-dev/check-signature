    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>Private-public key cryptography allows you to sign arbitrary messages. Anyone can take the output of such a signature and verify its validity.</p>
    <p>With this app, you can use your Ethereum Account to sign structured statements and share them in private or publicly.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="list-head">Private:</span> Create signatures directly in your browser and share the URL. Your data is not stored on our infrastructure.</li>
      <li><span class="list-head">Public (soon):</span> Publish your signature to IPFS and our APIs to make them publicly available and indexable.</li>
      <li><span class="list-head">Onchain (soon):</span> Write your signature to the blockchain and create an immutable timestamp and historical proof of your message.</li>
